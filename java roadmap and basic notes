 8. Linked Lists
✔️ Singly & Doubly
✔️ Add/Delete Nodes
✔️ Reverse LL (iterative & recursive)
✔️ Detect Cycle (Floyd's Algo)


🌲 9. Trees
✔️ Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree (BST)
✔️ Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
✔️ Height, Diameter
✔️ LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
✔️ Tree Traversals (BFS/DFS)


🔗 10. Graphs
✔️ Representations: Adjacency List/Matrix

🧠 12. Greedy Algorithms
✔️ Activity Selection
✔️ Fractional Knapsack
✔️ Huffman Encoding


🧬 13. Dynamic Programming (DP)
✔️ Fibonacci Memoization & Tabulation
✔️ 0/1 Knapsack
✔️ Longest Common Subsequence
✔️ Longest Increasing Subsequence
✔️ DP on Strings, Grids

🧠 14. Bit Manipulation (for logic boost)
✔️ Even/Odd using bits
✔️ XOR tricks
✔️ Swap using XOR
✔️ Bitmasking (for DP+bits)


😊🏁 Final Tip:
“DSA is not about remembering solutions. It’s about learning how to think like a problem solver.” 💡

1... What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.

🔍 Simple Definition:
Java ek programming language hai jisme hum apps, websites, games, and software bana sakte hain — aur ek baar code likh ke, kahin bhi chala sakte hain. 💻🌍


java use in real life:
✅ Android apps (e.g. Instagram, Paytm)
✅ Banking software (ICICI, SBI systems)
✅ Web apps (backend systems)
✅ Enterprise applications (like ERP)
✅ Games & Desktop tools

🧃 Final Line:
Java = Simple, Powerful & Everywhere!
Agar coding ka hero banna hai, to Java ek perfect start hai 💪


💼 What is Java Used For?
Java is used to build powerful applications in many fields — from mobile to banking to big companies!

🔥 1. Android App Development
Java is one of the official languages for Android apps.
📱 Examples: WhatsApp, Instagram, Paytm (earlier versions)

🖥️ 2. Desktop Applications
You can build full software apps that run on Windows/Mac.
🛠️ Tools like: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA

🌐 3. Web Applications (Backend)
Java is widely used for backend development with frameworks like Spring Boot.
🌍 Example: Banking websites, e-commerce apps, CRM software

🏦 4. Banking and Enterprise Systems
Java is super secure, so it’s trusted by banks and big companies.
💸 Used by: ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Infosys, TCS, etc.

☁️ 5. Cloud Applications
Java runs in cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
☁️ Used for scalable apps, serverless functions

🧠 6. Data Science / Big Data
Java is used with Apache Hadoop, Spark, etc. for data processing.
📊 Big companies use Java for analytics

🎮 7. Game Development
Java + LibGDX or jMonkeyEngine are used to build 2D/3D games.
🎮 Example: Minecraft (originally made in Java)

🔬 8. Embedded Systems / IoT
Java is used in smart devices like TVs, washing machines, ATMs!
📟 Java ME (Micro Edition) is used here.

🎯 Final Line:
Java is everywhere! It’s like the engine that powers the digital world — from your phone to your bank to your smart fridge! 😄


📝 What is File Naming Convention in Java?
Java file name = name of the public class inside it + .java extension
✅ Basic Rules:
1️⃣ File name must match the public class name

2️⃣ Use PascalCase for class/file names
Means: Each word starts with a capital letter
✅ Examples:
MyFirstProgram.java
StudentDetails.java
HelloWorld.java

3️⃣ Avoid special characters
❌ Don’t use: @, #, %, space, -
✅ Use only letters, numbers, and underscores (if really needed — but better to use PascalCase).

4️⃣ File extension must be .java
For all Java source files, the extension must be .java
