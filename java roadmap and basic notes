 Java Basics (Must before DSA):

✔️ Syntax
✔️ Loops, If-Else
✔️ Arrays, Strings
✔️ Functions
✔️ OOP Basics (Class, Object, Inheritance)


Maths for DSA (Easy but useful!)
✔️ Prime numbers
✔️ GCD/LCM
✔️ Factorial
✔️ Power of 2
✔️ Number Systems (Binary, Decimal)


3. Arrays
✔️ Basic operations (insert, delete, search)
✔️ Prefix Sum
✔️ Sliding Window
✔️ Kadane’s Algorithm
✔️ 2D Arrays & Diagonal Traversal


4. Strings
✔️ Palindrome
✔️ Anagram
✔️ Character count using Hashing
✔️ StringBuilder (for fast editing)


📚 5. Recursion
✔️ Base case + Recursive case
✔️ Factorial, Fibonacci
✔️ Backtracking basics (N-Queen, Rat in Maze)
✔️ Subsets, Permutations

🪟 6. Searching & Sorting
✔️ Binary Search
✔️ Lower/Upper Bound
✔️ Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort
✔️ Sorting Comparisons


🧺 7. Stacks & Queues
✔️ Stack using Array/LinkedList
✔️ Queue using Array/Circular
✔️ Applications: Balanced Brackets, Next Greater Element


 8. Linked Lists
✔️ Singly & Doubly
✔️ Add/Delete Nodes
✔️ Reverse LL (iterative & recursive)
✔️ Detect Cycle (Floyd's Algo)


🌲 9. Trees
✔️ Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree (BST)
✔️ Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
✔️ Height, Diameter
✔️ LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
✔️ Tree Traversals (BFS/DFS)


🔗 10. Graphs
✔️ Representations: Adjacency List/Matrix
✔️ BFS, DFS
✔️ Dijkstra's Algo
✔️ Topological Sort
✔️ Disjoint Set Union (DSU)


📊 11. Hashing & Maps
✔️ HashSet, HashMap in Java
✔️ Frequency count
✔️ Map-based questions (2Sum, Group Anagrams)

🧠 12. Greedy Algorithms
✔️ Activity Selection
✔️ Fractional Knapsack
✔️ Huffman Encoding


🧬 13. Dynamic Programming (DP)
✔️ Fibonacci Memoization & Tabulation
✔️ 0/1 Knapsack
✔️ Longest Common Subsequence
✔️ Longest Increasing Subsequence
✔️ DP on Strings, Grids

🧠 14. Bit Manipulation (for logic boost)
✔️ Even/Odd using bits
✔️ XOR tricks
✔️ Swap using XOR
✔️ Bitmasking (for DP+bits)


😊🏁 Final Tip:
“DSA is not about remembering solutions. It’s about learning how to think like a problem solver.” 💡

1... What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.

🔍 Simple Definition:
Java ek programming language hai jisme hum apps, websites, games, and software bana sakte hain — aur ek baar code likh ke, kahin bhi chala sakte hain. 💻🌍


java use in real life:
✅ Android apps (e.g. Instagram, Paytm)
✅ Banking software (ICICI, SBI systems)
✅ Web apps (backend systems)
✅ Enterprise applications (like ERP)
✅ Games & Desktop tools

🧃 Final Line:
Java = Simple, Powerful & Everywhere!
Agar coding ka hero banna hai, to Java ek perfect start hai 💪
